# include things for interpretable machine learning like interphase for graphviz? etc.? 

# do a lot of graphviz stuff 

# e.g. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree for decision tree
# make option to make plots for trees in random forest 
# xgboost viz? 
# neural network viz? 
# make it a nice routine so all plots are similarly crisp and publication quality
